## Course description

Robot Framework is a pre-built test automation framework. By comparison... Robot Framework is much easier to learn than Selenium Webdriver (with Java, Python, C#, or PHP) because your scripts are written with English words instead of code.

If you're already an experienced user of Selenium Webdriver, Cucumber, or QTP/UFT, you'll quickly learn how elegant and capable Robot Framework is compared to those tools.

This 5+ hour video course will:

- Provide an overview of the free, open source Robot Framework test automation tool
- Teach you how to install & configure Robot Framework plus libraries for Selenium, API, database, and more
- Help you create & run your very first Selenium test automation script in just minutes
- Show you exactly how to create a Selenium Webdriver test automation script more easily
- Show you how to make a simple test automation script much more efficient & readable
- Help you discover how variables & page objects can make your test automation scripts more flexible
- Walk you through the basics of testing web (Selenium), API, database, XML, and files tests
